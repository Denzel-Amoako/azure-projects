# Creating a Dashboard in Azure

## Goal
Practice customizing dashboards in the Azure portal to monitor and organize resources effectively.

## What I Built
- A custom **Customer Dashboard** with multiple tiles (Clocks, All Resources, Resource Groups, Metrics, etc.).
- A cloned **Microsoft Entra Admin Dashboard** with user-focused tiles.

## Steps I Followed
1. Created a new custom dashboard.  
2. Renamed it to **Customer Dashboard**.  
3. Added and configured the first **Clock tile**.  
4. Added additional tiles (All resources, Resource groups, Metrics, Help + Support, Entra quick tasks, Marketplace).  
5. Cloned the dashboard into a new **Microsoft Entra Admin Dashboard** and customized it with user-related tiles.

## Notes / Gotchas
- Cloning dashboards is useful when creating variations for different roles (e.g., customers vs. admins).
