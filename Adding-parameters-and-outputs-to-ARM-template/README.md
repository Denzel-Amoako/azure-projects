# Azure ARM Parameters Project

This project demonstrates deploying an **Azure Storage Account** with an **Azure Resource Manager (ARM) template** that uses parameters, validation, and outputs.  
It was completed as part of my AZ-104 practice labs.

---

## What I Learned
- How to create parameters in an ARM template (`storageName`, `storageSKU`).
- How to enforce validation with `allowedValues`.
- How to deploy ARM templates using **PowerShell**.
- How to test valid and invalid parameter values.
- How to add outputs to return useful deployment information (storage account endpoints).
- How to verify deployments and outputs in the **Azure Portal**.

## Steps Completed

### Step 1 – Initial Template  
Created the basic ARM template structure.

### Step 6 – Deployment with Valid SKU  
Deployed successfully using `Standard_GRS`.

### Step 7 – Deployment with Invalid SKU  
Tested with `Basic` and deployment failed (as expected).

### Step 8 – Added Outputs  
Modified template to return storage account endpoints.

### Step 9 – Verified Outputs in PowerShell  
Outputs appeared in the terminal as JSON with blob, dfs, file, queue, table, and web endpoints.

### Step 10 – Verified Outputs in Azure Portal  
Checked the Outputs tab in the Portal for the latest deployment.

## Summary
This project shows how ARM templates can:  
- Accept parameters  
- Validate inputs  
- Return outputs  

It demonstrates real-world Infrastructure as Code (IaC) practices with Azure, making deployments reusable and reliable.
